# NW-Montana-Bush-Trip
 Montana, known as "Big Sky Country" and "The Treasure State", has plenty of beautiful places to explore via air. This journey, designed for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020, will take you around areas in Northwestern Montana where I grew up.

Leg 1: Troy (57S) to Eureka (88M)
Take off, fly south-east over the town of Troy and following the Kootenai River east. US Hwy 2 runs alongside the river. The Kootenay River is one of the uppermost major tributaries of the Columbia River, the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean. Approximately 15 nm of river flying and you will fly over Libby, MT, once a mining and timber city, it now is mostly a tourist attraction. Keep following the winding river east and as it turns north, you will fly over the Libby Dam. Continue up the large reservoir north, known as Lake Koocanusa. You'll pass just one brdige, the Koocanusa Bridge (longest and tallest in Montana) just before you reach the towns of Rexford and Eureka on your right. Rexford is just before reservoir widens and a valley appears headed southeast. Although Eureka is deeper into the valley, the the Eureka airport is located within a few miles of the Canadian border, so keep heading along the eastern shore of the reservoir until you see a series of lakes, with the airport at the northeastern edge and just west of Hwy 93, running north to the Canadian border.
